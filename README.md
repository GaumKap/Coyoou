# Coyoou

### description
Coyoou Project is an Graphic App, this will be an app for put and control/convert to print some information about your outgoings (and make something in C++ for my pleasure)

### Environment configuration
Environment configuration is based on Openclassroom tutorial and official SQLite website
available on my blog [HERE](https://gaumkap.blogspot.com/2020/07/gtk-sqlite-on-visual-studio-2019.html).
Note : If you have already installed GTK with another method verify in VS2019 project settings if you have the same directories for GTK+

** Recommended Configuration **
- Windows 10 2004
- Visual Studio 2019 (last releases)
- Desktop C++ module Installed (VS Installer)

### About Code

This is a C++ code with GTK+ and SQLite libraries/frameworks
This code is uncomplete and can't be used for production,

I propose a Alpha version of this app in Command Line (a0.0.1)
This Command Line will be removed when GUI development starting.
