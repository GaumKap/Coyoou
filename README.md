### description
Coyoou Project is an Graphic App, this will be an app for put and control/convert to print some information about your outgoings (and make something in C++ for my pleasure)

### Environment configuration
Environment configuration is based on openclassroom tutorial and official SQLite website
available on my blog [HERE](https://gaumkap.blogspot.com/2020/07/gtk-sqlite-on-visual-studio-2019.html).
Note : If you have already installed GTK with another method verify in VS2019 project settings if you have the same directories for GTK+

** Recomended Configuration **
- Windows 10 2004
- Visual Studio 2019 (last releases)
- Desktop C++ module Installed (VS Installer)

### About Code (xx/xx/xx)

This is a C++ code with GTK+ and SQLite libraries/frameworks
This code is uncomplete and can't be used for production,

**Note :** I have formation in C++ but this is the first time I make full project in C++, and I don't make C++ (not C++/CLI) since i've started a study project (end of 2019) with Node.js
**Note2 :** I make this for my own pleasure and why not improve my skills.

### Bug Report (xx/xx/xx)

The app is not usable now, but you can make suggest in C++ if you thing i'm wrong in some parts.

I will publish when it will be done a command line version for test the thing.
